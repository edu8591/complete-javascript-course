// *************** Coding Challenge #1 ***************

/*
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)

  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// * a closure is the closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone

// - less format - a closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. the function keeps a reference to its outer scopre, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.

// - analogy a closure makes sure that a function doesn't loose connection to variables that existed at the functions birth place

// analogy a closure is like a backpack that a function carries around wherever it goes. this backpack has all the variables that were present in the environment where the function was created

console.dir(booker); // we use this to chec the scope of the functions, and to check the scope
*/

// *************** More Closure, now with examples ***************

/*
//Example 1
// We don't necesarily need to return a function to use closures, but we can reasign a value to one

  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

const h = function () {
  const b = 777;
  f = function () {
    console.log(b);
  };
};

// calling this function we will assign f value to a function created from the g scope
g();
f(); // this runs the console log of a*23 defined in the g funciton scope

h(); // this should assign a another function to f
f();
console.dir(f);

//Example 2

const boardPassenger = function (n, wait) {
  const perGroup = n / 3;
  //use a timer
  // this callback function was running completely separated from the boardpassenger, so it got access to the perGroup variable and the arguments thanks to closures
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers`);
    console.log(`there are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passenges`);
  }, wait * 1000); //Whatever is inside the function will execute after the time runs out, time is given in milliseconds
  console.log(`Will start boarding in ${wait} seconds`);
};
const perGroup = 1000; // the closure has preference over the global scope, thats why it will no use perGroup defined in the global scope but will go to the variable defined within the boardPassenger function
boardPassenger(180, 5);

// *************** Coding Challenge #2 ***************

/*
This is more of a thinking challenge than a coding challenge ðŸ¤“

Take the IIFE below and at the end of the function, attach an event listener that changes the color of the selected h1 element ('header') to blue, each time the BODY element is clicked. Do NOT select the h1 element again!

And now explain to YOURSELF (or someone around you) WHY this worked! Take all the time you need. Think about WHEN exactly the callback function is executed, and what that means for the variables involved in this example.

    } else {
      header.style.color = 'red';
    }
  };
  togleColors();
})();

document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', togleColors);

// this works thanks to closures, the immediately invoked function expression was used to the the vatue of togleColors to a function which was created under the same scope as the header variable hence said new function will have permanent access to that variable environment
